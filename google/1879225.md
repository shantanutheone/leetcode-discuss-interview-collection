## Problem 1: Leaf Nodes with Maximum Root-to-Leaf Path Sum

### Description
Given a binary tree, return **all the leaf nodes** that lie on a path from the root such that the sum of values along the path is the **maximum** among all root-to-leaf paths.

### Input
- A binary tree `root` where each node contains an integer value.

### Output
- A list of integer values representing the leaf nodes that lie on a root-to-leaf path with the **maximum path sum**.

### Constraints
- The tree will have at least one node.
- Node values can be negative or positive.
- Multiple leaves can exist with the same maximum sum path.

### Example

```
Input:
5
/
4 8
/ /
11 13 4
/ \
7 2 1

Output: [7, 1]
Explanation:

Path 1: 5→4→11→7 = 27

Path 2: 5→4→11→2 = 22

Path 3: 5→8→13 = 26

Path 4: 5→8→4→1 = 18

Maximum path sum = 27 and the corresponding leaf node is 7.

If there were multiple such paths with the same sum, all their leaf nodes would be included.

## Problem 2: Longest Valid Shrinking Word

### Description
You are given a dictionary of strings. A word is considered **valid** if, by **repeatedly removing one character at any position**, the resulting intermediate strings are all present in the dictionary, and the final string has a length of 1.

Return the longest such valid word. If there are multiple answers, return any one of them.

### Input
- A list of strings `dictionary` containing unique lowercase strings.

### Output
- A string representing the longest valid word based on the defined shrinking rule.

### Constraints
- `1 <= len(dictionary) <= 10^4`
- Each word has at most length 100
- All strings consist of lowercase English letters

### Example
```
Input: ["string", "sring", "sing", "ing", "ng", "g"]
Output: "string"
Explanation:
"string" → "sring" → "sing" → "ing" → "ng" → "g" — all intermediate strings are in the dictionary.

Input: ["abc", "ab", "bc", "c"]
Output: "abc"
Explanation:
"abc" → "ab" → "b" is not valid since "b" is not in the dictionary.
But "abc" → "bc" → "c" is valid. So, "abc" is a valid shrinking word.

## Problem 3: Maximum Total Excitement Path

### Description
You are given:
- A set of `N` cities, each with an associated **excitement value**.
- A set of `M` **bidirectional flights** connecting pairs of cities.

You must choose 4 **distinct** cities A, B, C, and D such that:
- There is a direct flight from A → B, B → C, and C → D.
- The **total excitement** (sum of the excitement values of A, B, C, D) is maximized.

Return the path and the corresponding total excitement.

### Input
- A list of `N` cities, each represented by a string `city_name` and an integer `excitement_value`.
- A list of `M` direct flights, where each flight connects two cities and is bidirectional.

### Output
- A path of 4 cities (A → B → C → D) as a list.
- An integer representing the total excitement for that path.

### Constraints
- All cities are uniquely named.
- All flights are bidirectional.
- Cities and flights form a connected undirected graph.
- There exists at least one valid path of 4 cities with the required connections.
```
Input:
Cities:
New York 10000
San Francisco 1000
Texas 500
LA 20000
Chicago 3000
San Jose 900

Flights:
New York <-> San Francisco
New York <-> LA
Chicago <-> LA
San Jose <-> San Francisco

Output:
["San Francisco", "New York", "LA", "Chicago"]
Total Excitement: 1000 + 10000 + 20000 + 3000 = 34000
```
